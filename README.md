# ALGORITHMS DESIGNING OUR FUTURE
Critical engagement with text-to-image algorithms and call for interdisciplinary research


Simply typing a sentence and having a beautiful image drawn by a magical Artificial Intelligence - a fascinating and at the same time scaring thought. And since the announcement of DallÂ·E in January 2021 by OpenAI and all the other algorithms that followed it does not seem to be too far off to think a machine might be creative oder intelligent.

A closer look demystifies those assumptions and shows that those mechanisms rely on statistics and training data and are far from being creative. But still these algorithms have to potential to drastically change the way we produce, consume and receive images.

The goal of the website is to display the developement of text-to-image algorithms as an interdisciplinary project as well as finding limitations and potentials in these algorithms.
Therefore, I trained a text-to-image algorithm with my own data to find out more about the relation between training data and outputs. Through comparison with existing models, like Latent Diffusion I summed up several Prompt Engineering methods.

This research showed diverese concepts and angles from various fields that need to be discussed while developing text-to-image models. From tech, semiotics, aesthetics, multimodality to art history and data research, there are many issues to be solved.
